However, from a network perspective, in a highly connected graph where each node is connected to many other nodes, the opposite of love approaches statistical independence (i.e., \\(\\rho = 0\\)), which corresponds to indifference.\nBuilding on this conceptual framework, I offer an interpretation of negative spatial autocorrelation in graphs. Using a random walk based simulation algorithm, I generate synthetic network data that are negatively autocorrelated and intrinsically consistent with the underlying graph structure. This enables systematic exploration of how graph topology, particularly clustering and node degree, affects the emergence and behavior of negatively correlated spatial structures.\nhttps://hnaganob.shinyapps.io/car-dependence-parameter-diagnostics/\nTo support this analysis, I developed an interactive Shiny web application which computes the graph-specific admissible range of the spatial dependence parameter.
