## Overview

Tobler’s first law of geography states, “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” [@Tobler1970]. I extend this principle to the analysis of the brain. My research lies at the intersection of spatial statistics and network analysis, with a primary focus on brain connectivity.

With the bold assumption that spatial structure itself encodes information about data behavior within the space, I analyze network data by focusing on neighborhood dependencies. More specifically, I use a Markov random field approach to address Tobler’s principle on single-subject brain network data.

My work is divided into the following three main areas.
